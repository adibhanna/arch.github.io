A comprehensive, interactive checklist for designing robust and scalable software systems.

**Live:** [arch.adibhanna.dev](https://arch.adibhanna.dev)

## What is this?

A questionnaire-based framework that guides software architects and engineers through the critical decisions involved in system design. It covers 9 phases of architecture planning, from initial problem discovery to future-proofing.

The tool helps you:
- Systematically think through all aspects of your system design
- Document your architectural decisions and trade-offs
- Track progress as you work through the framework
- Export your notes as markdown for documentation

## The 9 Phases

| Phase | Focus |
|-------|-------|
| **01. Discovery & Problem Definition** | Define the problem, users, and constraints |
| **02. Requirements Analysis** | Quantify scale, performance, and reliability needs |
| **03. Data & Domain Modeling** | Model entities, relationships, and boundaries |
| **04. Architecture Design** | Choose system structure and technologies |
| **05. Resilience & Failure Planning** | Plan for failures and recovery |
| **06. Security & Privacy** | Address authentication, authorization, and compliance |
| **07. Observability & Operations** | Plan monitoring, logging, and debugging |
| **08. Team & Organization** | Align architecture with team capabilities |
| **09. Evolution & Future-Proofing** | Design for change and growth |
